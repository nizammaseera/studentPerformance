Developed an End to End Machine Learning application to
predict Student Performance in 3 subjects based on various
parameters.
● Exploratory Data analysis revealed a roughly linear relation
between the parameters and scores, so Ridge, Linear
Regression, Catboosting Regressor, Adaboost Regressor,
Random Forest Regressor, Lasso, XGBRegressor,
K-Neighbors Regressor and Decision Tree methods were
used, out of which Linear Regression based model was chosen.
● The entire application was developed in an End to End way.
● The prediction pipeline was developed using Flask Web App.
● Deployed the application in AWS cloud using CI/CD pipelines.
● Tech Stack : Python, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, AWS, Flask,
Git.
